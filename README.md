Rolo is a modern CLI tool designed to streamline your web development workflow. It provides fast project initialization, hot module reloading (HMR), and quick build capabilities for efficient development.

## Features

- **Project Initialization (`init`)**: Instantly scaffold new projects with best practices and ready-to-go templates.
- **Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**: Experience lightning-fast updates in your development environment without full page reloads.
- **Quick Builds**: Build your projects rapidly with optimized configurations for both development and production.
- **Template Support**: Choose from React and Vanilla JS templates to kickstart your project.
- **Easy CLI Commands**: Simple and intuitive commands for all major actions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Rolo** (if published to npm):

   ```sh
   npm install -g rolo
   ```

2. **Initialize a New Project**:

   ```

3. **Start Development Server with HMR**:

   ```sh

   ```

4. **Build Your Project**:

   ```

## CLI Commands

- `rolo init` – Scaffold a new project
